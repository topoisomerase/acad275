  <h1>a guide to the marvel cinematic universe</h1>
  <h2>flowchart</h2>

  <div id="mission">
    <h2>mission</h2>
    <p>a semi-comprehensive guide meant to inform on the movies in the marvel cinematic universe, including the big 3 superhero trilogies (iron man, captain america, and thor) as well as the crossover Avengers movies and other character series</p>
  </div>

  <div id="audience">
    <h2>audience</h2>
    <p>as the scale of the mcu is a little big for this individual class project, this website is intended to serve as an introduction mainly for new fans as a reference for the franchise, or old fans looking to brush up on the basic information. it is not intended to be a wiki or other such site.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="content">
    <h2>content</h2>
    <p>the main content for this website will include the movies (a summary, possibly brief reviews), the character/cast list, and fun facts/fan lore. each of the sub-franchises will have their own movie and character/cast introductions, with info about the movie such as director, box office numbers, etc. i'll also include a watch list ordered by 1) release date (phases) and 2) chronology. a brief explanation of what the phases are and the future of the mcu. MCU movies outside of the big3/4 include: spiderman, guardians of the galaxy, black panther, captain marvel, ant man, hulk - i forgot about these in the flowchart, sorry, they won't each get their own page though. there's also movies related to marvel but aren't in the mcu (xmen, deadpool, etc) which will go in the +more page</p>
  </div>

  <div id="graphics">
    <h2>graphics</h2>
    <p>each movie will have its movie poster and each (main) character/cast member will have their own photo. other possible graphics include: symbols/art for the main characters, a collage for the header.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="notes">
    <h2>notes</h2>
    <p>i'm biased towards iron man, so lots of red and gold and black. red and white for the marvel logo, as well as blue and white for phase 4. though each page will have a color scheme based on the franchise its in (ex: red/white/blue for captain america), based on the movie posters. i want the home page to be a full page image, with a nav directing to the subpages. the subpages may or may not be one-page, scrolling layouts. each page will have a similar layout because each of the main subpages consists of a trilogy and lots of overlapping characters. marvel has their own website for this, but mine will be much simpler.</p>
